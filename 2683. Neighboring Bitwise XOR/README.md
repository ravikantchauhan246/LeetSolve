# doesValidArrayExist - Solution Explanation

This repository contains the implementation of the `doesValidArrayExist` method, which determines whether a valid original array (`org`) exists based on a given derived array.

## Problem Explanation

Given an array `derived`, the task is to determine if a valid array `org` can exist such that:

1. `derived[i] = org[i] ^ org[i+1]` for `0 â‰¤ i < n-1`
2. `derived[n-1] = org[n-1] ^ org[0]` (circular condition)

### Key Insight

To solve this problem, we leverage the XOR property:

- XORing a number with itself yields 0: `x ^ x = 0`.
- XOR is associative and commutative, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter.

Using these properties, the XOR-sum of all elements in the `derived` array should be 0 for a valid `org` to exist. This is because each element in `org` appears exactly twice during the XOR operations in the derived array, effectively canceling itself out.

### Example

For a `derived` array of length 4:
```
derived[0] = org[0] ^ org[1]
derived[1] = org[1] ^ org[2]
derived[2] = org[2] ^ org[3]
derived[3] = org[3] ^ org[0]
```

Taking the XOR of all elements in `derived`:
```
XOR-sum = derived[0] ^ derived[1] ^ derived[2] ^ derived[3]
         = (org[0] ^ org[1]) ^ (org[1] ^ org[2]) ^ (org[2] ^ org[3]) ^ (org[3] ^ org[0])
         = (org[0] ^ org[0]) ^ (org[1] ^ org[1]) ^ (org[2] ^ org[2]) ^ (org[3] ^ org[3])
         = 0
```

If the XOR-sum of `derived` equals 0, a valid `org` exists; otherwise, it does not.

## Code Explanation

### Method Signature
```java
public boolean doesValidArrayExist(int[] derived)
```

### Parameters
- `derived`: An integer array representing the XOR-differences of the `org` array.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate through the elements of `derived`, updating `sum` as `sum ^= derived[i]`.
3. Return `true` if `sum == 0`, otherwise `false`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The algorithm iterates through the `derived` array once.

### Space Complexity
- **O(1)**: No additional space is used; only a single integer variable (`sum`) is maintained.

## Example Usage

### Input
```java
int[] derived = {1, 2, 3, 1};
```

### Output
```java
Solution solution = new Solution();
boolean result = solution.doesValidArrayExist(derived);
// Output: false
```

This implementation efficiently checks the validity of the `derived` array using the XOR property, with minimal computation and memory usage.
